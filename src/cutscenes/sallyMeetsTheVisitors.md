Sally: I've finally found you, Spike!
I need the Visitors help. I've lost my base case.

Spike: Well, who stole it? Did somebody steal it?

Sally: Yes, somebody stole it. I need it back
before I fade from existence. It was definitely the Segfaults!
I need you to help me fight them!

Spike: Okay, okay. Fine. But I need you to help me first.
We're going to collect as many gems as we can.

Sally: Why do we need gems?

Spike: We need gems to get coins. We can use them to fight
or keep them as treasure!

Sally: I don't really understand how that helps, but okay. Deal.

Spike: Let's go!
